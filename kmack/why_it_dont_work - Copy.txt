Problems:

- code is terrible

- Model is overfitting
    - unbalanced dataset probably the culprit bcz model is predicting 4.smthing for every data pt
        - and 4.smthing is like the most common data pt
    - how to deal with this
        - I have NO CLUE HOW TO DEAL WITH THIS

            - update I have a clue... scrap the whole thing and build a bidirectional LSTM to predict rating just on review text
